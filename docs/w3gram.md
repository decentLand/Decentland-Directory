<h1>Synopsis</h1>
Since most traditional social media platforms are centralized, the emerging decentralized social media platforms promise a different way of data production and control.
Most importantly, it enables users to have full control over their data with no limits, and that's what <b>w3gram</b> will provide.

<h1>w3gram as a word</h1>

- <i>"w3" :</i> reffers to web3.0 , a decentralised, open source, peer to peer protocol.
- <i>"gram" </i> indicating a drawing or something written or recorded

Therefore <i><b>w3gram</i></b> indicates the act of writing on blockchain.

<h1>Inspirations</h1>
w3gram is hybrid of several ideas combined into one merger protocol:

<h2>reddit:</h2>
Reddit is a community-determined aggregator of content. It is a social platform where users submit posts that other users 'upvote' or 'downvote' based on if they like it.
it's the self-proclaimed <i>“front page of the internet”</i>.
<b>What's insipred from reddit?</b>
inspired features are:

- communities as forums
- subreddits
- lot of subjects discussions: philosophy, science, technology,politics, etecera.
- karma

<b>w3gram will fix:</b>
- skeptical fan base and the Reddit system's negative feedback option
- community centralization: by admins
- classifying users on their Karma regardless their content
- non-clear rules to join a community or to guarantee admin's allow on posts sharing

<h2>KarmaDAO:</h2>
