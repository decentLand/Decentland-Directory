<h1>Synopsis</h1>
Since most traditional social media platforms are centralized, the emerging decentralized social media platforms promise a different way of data production and control.
Most importantly, it enables users to have full control over their data with no limits, and that's what <b>w3gram</b> will provide.

<h1>w3gram as a word</h1>

- <i>"w3" :</i> reffers to web3.0 , a decentralised, open source, peer to peer protocol.
- <i>"gram" </i> indicating a drawing or something written or recorded

Therefore <i><b>w3gram</i></b> indicates the act of writing on blockchain.

<h1>Inspirations</h1>
w3gram is hybrid of several ideas combined into one merger protocol:
