<h1>Synopsis</h1>
Since most traditional social media platforms are centralized, the emerging decentralized social media platforms promise a different way of data production and control.
Most importantly, it enables users to have full control over their data with no limits, and that's what <b>decent land</b> will provide.

<h1>decent land as a word</h1>

- <i>"decent" :</i> nodding to decency and decentralization in the same time.
- <i>"land" </i> indicating the sum of tribuses (communities) created over the protocol. 

Therefore <i><b>decent land</i></b> reffers to the hope of creating a decent monetized social network.

<h1>Inspirations</h1>
decent land is hybrid of several ideas and protocols combined into one merger protocol:

<h2>reddit:</h2>
Reddit is a community-determined aggregator of content. It is a social platform where users submit posts that other users 'upvote' or 'downvote' based on if they like it.
it's the self-proclaimed “front page of the internet”


<b>What's insipred from reddit?</b>


inspired features are:

- communities as forums
- subreddits
- lot of subjects discussions: philosophy, science, technology,politics, etecera.
- karma

decent land will try to fix:
- skeptical fan base and the Reddit system's negative feedback option
- community centralization: owned by admins
- classifying users basing on their Karma regardless their content
- unclear rules to join a community or to guarantee admin's allow on posts sharing

<h2>KarmaDAO:</h2>

According to Andrew Lee Medium <a href="https://andrwlee.medium.com/announcing-karma-dao-first-ever-token-permissioned-networking-chat-group-on-telegram-5feab7a54def">article</a>, Karma DAO is the first <i>token-permissioned networking chat group on Telegram</i> based on Ethereum blockchain.

<b>What's insipred from karmaDAO?</b>

inspired features are:

- Token-Permissioned DAO
- decentralized social network
- Community Ownership Economy

decent land will try to fix:
- the act of using centralised third party in DAO's core Protocol: Telegram
- User experience
- Protocol's non unification
- Permanent archiving of user's content

<h2>Public Square Protocol</h2>
After Twitter suspend of Trump's account POTUS, and the mysterious privacy policy of Twitter foundation, Sam Williams announced in a <a href="https://twitter.com/samecwilliams/status/1347741160165531655?s=20">tweet</a> about a data protocol for an unbiased public square based on Arweave.

<br><br>
<b>What's insipred from Public Square Protocol?</b>

inspired features are:

- Open protocol, anyone can join the network
- unbiased, rulesless & simple
- permanent storage of discussions
- on-chain user activity

decent land will try to fix

- presence of protocol's dashboard: UI
- monetizing the social protocol by a PSC
- user experience: hardcoded posts


<h1>decent land protocol structure</h1>

According the the pros and cons mentioned above, decent land will be a "better" hybrid built ***totally on-chain*** 
 
 <b>Tribus Structure</b>
 
 Tribus structure will be similar to Merkle Patricia Trie or "Merkle Root" in Ethereum blockchain.
 
keywords:

- Entry trie: Tribus
- sub-node: post in a Tribus
- reply: post's reply(ies)
